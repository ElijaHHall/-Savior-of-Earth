# Savior of The Earth

I originally intended my game to involve more collision detection, more "enemies", and a little bit of a story. I ended up completing my game, however, in order to fulfill my MVP, I made sure to create a counter for how many "blasts" my main character made, and upon a certain amount, the user "saves the world". It is not as competitive as I wanted the game to be. For example, I planned for the game to have a player 1 and 2, but I spent too much time getting collision detection to actually function.
